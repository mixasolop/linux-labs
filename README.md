# Linux Concurrency & Process Labs (C, Linux)

This repository contains **hands-on C labs focused on Linux systems programming and concurrency**, developed as part
of operating system and systems programming course in uni. These examples demonstrate core concepts of OS like
thread synchronization, process creation, and inter-thread communication using POSIX APIs.




------


The code in this repo exercises several OS concepts:

- **POSIX threads (`pthread`)**
- **Thread synchronization primitives** (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, barriers)
- **Process creation and control** (`fork`, `wait`)
- **Race condition management and correct synchronization**
- **Basic inter-thread and inter-process coordination**

Each example focuses on one or two concepts and illustrates how to use them in practice.
