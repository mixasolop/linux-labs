# Linux Labs – Concurrency and Operating Systems (C)

This repository contains laboratory exercises written in C and tested on Linux.

All programs use POSIX APIs and focus on operating system work,
especially processes, threads, and synchronization.

## What is covered
- POSIX threads (pthread)
- Mutexes
- Semaphores
- Condition variables
- Barriers
- Process creation using fork()
- Basic parent–child synchronization

## Tools
- Language: C
- OS: Linux
- Libraries: pthread, semaphore, unistd
- Debugging: gdb (basic)

Each folder contains a small example program and a short README explaining
what problem it solves and how it works.
